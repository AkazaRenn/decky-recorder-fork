# Decky Recorder

This plugin is heavily based on the Recapture-Plugin for Crankshaft from Avery: https://git.sr.ht/~avery/recapture
In particular a lot of code for the gst-launch-1.0-command itself and the additionally needed dependencies were taken from the Recapture-Plugin.

This plugin was made with the decky-plugin-template (https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-plugin-template)

Please do not judge my code, I am bad!

This plugin is still in WIP.
